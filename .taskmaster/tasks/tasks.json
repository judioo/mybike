Perform a comprehensive analysis of the wolfis.ae catalog API:\n   - Document the API endpoints, authentication methods, and rate limits\n   - Map out the complete data schema for products, categories, and variants\n   - Identify any custom fields or metadata that need to be preserved\n\n2. Study the BoostCommerce Filter system:\n   - Document how filters are structured and applied to products\n   - Analyze how filter options are generated from product attributes\n   - Determine how to replicate or improve this functionality in the new system\n\n3. Design the product data structure for the Next.js application:\n   - Create Typescript interfaces for product types\n   - Define database schema if using a database solution\n   - Ensure the structure supports all filtering and sorting requirements\n\n4. Develop migration scripts:\n   - Create Node.js scripts to extract data from wolfis.ae API\n   - Implement data transformation logic to map to the new structure\n   - Add validation to ensure data integrity during migration\n   - Include error handling and logging for troubleshooting\n\n5. Implement incremental migration strategy:\n   - Design the scripts to support both full and delta migrations\n   - Add functionality to track migration progress and resume if interrupted\n   - Create a verification process to compare source and migrated data\n\n6. Document the entire migration process:\n   - Create technical documentation for the migration architecture\n   - Provide a step-by-step guide for executing the migration\n   - Include troubleshooting information for common issues\n<info added on 2025-06-18T08:25:24.954Z>\n7.

Unit Testing:\n   - Write tests for data transformation functions\n   - Create mock API responses for testing extraction logic\n   - Test validation rules for ensuring data integrity\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Test the complete migration pipeline with a subset of real data\n   - Verify that all product relationships (categories, variants, etc.) are preserved\n   - Test incremental migration with modified products\n\n3. Data Verification:\n   - Develop automated comparison tools to verify migrated data against source\n   - Check for data loss or corruption during migration\n   - Verify counts of products, categories, and other entities match\n\n4. Filter System Testing:\n   - Test that all filter options are correctly generated from the migrated data\n   - Verify filter functionality works as expected in the new system\n   - Compare filter performance between old and new systems\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Measure migration script performance with different data volumes\n   - Test API load during migration to ensure it doesn't impact production\n   - Verify query performance on the migrated data structure",
